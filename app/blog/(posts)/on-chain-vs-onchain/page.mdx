<RelativeDate date={new Date("2023-04-05T13:04:19.099Z")} type="relative" />, [Jesse Pollak](https://x.com/jessepollak) popularized the term "onchain" in the lead-up to Base's [public launch](https://base.mirror.xyz/KPrKIukePtM2Iz945_3GpQJ-tgMf1hoato5isStLXJI) to help realize its vision: bring the next million builders and billion users onchain to accelerate a global, decentralized financial system.

  fewer characters, more aesthetically pleasing, clearer analogy to online.

It quickly became a symbol to represent the shift to a better, more open, and permissionless future, as well as a unifying force of sorts; if you're "onchain," you're part of the movement.

Prior to this, the term "on-chain" was generally seen as the grammatically correct variant, as well as a more nuanced term to describe [fully on-chain projects](https://0xchain.art): those whose logic/metadata are fully constructible from the blockchain.

## On[-]chain art battle

As the two terms began coexisting, some friendly banter emerged between the pro-"onchain" and pro-"on-chain" camps.
[PartyDAO](https://x.com/prtyDAO) captured and directed some of this energy into a playful competition called [Party vs. Party: On[-]chain Art Battle](https://partyvs.party) ([post](https://x.com/i/status/1674447750182719489)).

The premise was simple: participants would form 2 teams ([team "on-chain"](https://www.party.app/party/0x1c409297dd82167B6be3e79D4bF0B6f7a6ff0dB4) and [team "onchain"](https://www.party.app/party/0x5d7Cdeea959c61A467f319B8e7Ed3DbB390fF01a=)) by minting membership NFTs then spend a week creating art to acquire as many 0.01 ETH open edition mints as possible.
The winning team would be the one with the most mints, and they would receive all proceeds from the event.

### The competition

I joined team "on-chain," mainly because of my [enjoyment](https://gallery.so/fiveoutofnine/galleries/2dXu2CmM2LHQOceZKfh3MYxF36m) of fully on-chain projects.

Within team "on-chain," there was some initial discussions about what art to create: should it be something playful, a performance art, a custom smart contract, etc.?
For example, an idea that sort of gained support in the chat was to have the NFT be the word "on-chain," except the number of hyphens increases with each mint (e.g. after 5 mints, it would be "on-----chain").

Eventually, we decided on the idea of "adopting a hyphen," where the open edition NFT (aptly named "adoption tickets") could be burned in exchange for a generative ASCII character NFT.
Soon after, [scotato](https://x.com/scotato) [designed the characters](https://hyphenation.vercel.app) with an initial [implementation](https://github.com/scotato/hyphenation/blob/4240554f16dce96d13297c4f03299509dee49884/app/character.tsx), which looked something like:

<HyphenNFT defaultSeed={1365n} />

### The on-chain implementation

## Conclusion

wat does onchain and on-chain mean now
