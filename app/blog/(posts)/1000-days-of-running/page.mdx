As of <RelativeDate date={new Date("2025-05-27T03:03:10.000Z")} type="absolute" />, I've ran every day for the last 1000 days.
During that time, I covered <Distance m={18_779_010} /> running and <Distance m={24_001_620} /> in total:

## Motivation

I was 19 when I started running.
Up until that point, I had basically 0 prior athletic experience apart from occasionally running recreationally.
I had tried a few times to run properly, but I [never managed](#) to be consistent for more than a few weeks.

There wasn&apos;t any particular reason or motivation that pushed me to try running consistently again.
It probably felt like previous attempts, where I&apos;d run a few times a week for like 4 weeks before fizzling out again&mdash;except this time, I had more freedom around my schedule because I was out of school and living alone.

The main thing I remember being intentional about was realizing that running is a sport I can reach close to my max athletic potential at, despite starting late (by sports standards).
The same can not be said for many other sports like swimming, soccer, or tennis.
It obviously helps to have started earlier, but long-distance running relies heavily on having strong foundational aerobic fitness and a large mileage base, which are both things that require a lot of time to build up.

Basically, you can offset biological degradation from aging with training volume;
90% of being a good long-distance runner is just being super consistent over a long period of time while staying healthy.
This is what allows distance runners to peak well into their 30s ([Kipchoge&apos;s 2:01:09 WR at 37](https://worldathletics.org/news/report/eliud-kipchoge-world-record-berlin-marathon-2022), [Bekele&apos;s 2:01:41 at 37](https://worldathletics.org/news/report/bekele-berlin-marathon-2019)).

<Callout intent="info">
  I actually don&apos;t know how true this is anymore because with the [recent uptick](https://www.vox.com/even-better/385283/train-marathon-gen-z) in long-distance running, it seems like fast marathoners are getting younger: [Kiptum's 2:00:35 WR at 23](https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-label-road-races/news/chicago-marathon-2023-kiptum-world-record-hassan), [Kiplimo&apos;s 57:31 WR at 21](https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-label-road-races/news/jacob-kiplimo-world-half-marathon-record-lisbon).
  Maybe long-distance running has just never been as competitive as the shorter events because they have a shorter lifespan (probably why many of the greatest marathoners like Kipchoge and Bekele started out as track athletes).
  What I said seems at least partially true, though: as of <RelativeDate date={new Date(1748472248646)} type="absolute" />, the average age of the [top 100 1500m runners](https://worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middlelong/1500-metres/all/men/senior) was 25.3 years old vs. 28.4 years for the [top 100 marathoners](https://worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/road-running/marathon/outdoor/men/senior).
  Or maybe I just self-psyoped myself into running <Distance className="text-blue-11 hover:text-blue-12" m={18_779_010} />.

It&apos;s obviously fine to do things for enjoyment, fitness, social purposes, or whatever else, but I didn&apos;t want to get into something intensely knowing I&apos;d be hard-capped no matter how hard I worked.
That doesn&apos;t mean I won&apos;t want to start doing new things in the future;
I think it&apos;s more like: if I was going to start some hobby at the point/age I was at, I might as well pick something I can see the most growth and improvement in.

## The 1000 days

### First 6 months (~18%)

### First year (~37%)

### Second year (~73%)

### 1000 days + future (100%)

## Learnings

Beyond the stuff I obviously learned directly about running (e.g. how to run, recover, etc.), here&apos;s a list of things I learned that I thought were interesting:
