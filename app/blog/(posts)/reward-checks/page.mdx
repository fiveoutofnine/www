About 2 years ago, I learned about [Donald Knuth&apos;s reward checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check).
They&apos;re checks awarded by Knuth to people who find errors or make substantial suggestions on his published work, typically worth a "hexadecimal dollar" (denoted `0x$1.00`), or \$2.56.
The MIT Technology Review [describes](https://www.technologyreview.com/1999/09/01/236540/rewriting-the-bible-in-0s-and-1s) them as "among computerdom&apos;s most prized trophies."

I love stuff like this.
It speaks to Knuth&apos;s perfectionism and wit, and it&apos;s also just a really fun, unique idea.
Feels like a representation of his values and sense of humor that you can also feel when reading his work, like [Digital Typography](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html).
