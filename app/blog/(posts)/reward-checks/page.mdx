About 2 years ago, I learned about [Donald Knuth&apos;s reward checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check).
They&apos;re checks awarded by Knuth to people who find errors or make substantial suggestions on his published work, typically worth a "hexadecimal dollar" (denoted `0x$1.00`), or \$2.56.
The MIT Technology Review [describes](https://www.technologyreview.com/1999/09/01/236540/rewriting-the-bible-in-0s-and-1s) them as "among computerdom&apos;s most prized trophies."

I love stuff like this.
It speaks to Knuth&apos;s perfectionism and wit, and it&apos;s also just a really fun, unique idea.
Feels like a representation of his values and sense of humor that you can also feel when reading his work, like [Digital Typography](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html).

## Bank of San Serriffe

Knuth&apos;s reward checks were real, negotiable checks until he was forced to stop in 2008 because of check fraud:

<Blockquote source={{ label: 'Donald Knuth', url: 'https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news08.html' }}>
  Leading banks and investment funds have been foundering, because of bad debts and lack of trust; and other, less well-known kinds of fiscal chaos are also on the horizon.
  For example, due to an unfixable security flaw in the way funds are now transferred electronically, worldwide, **it is no longer safe to write personal checks**.
</Blockquote>

His solution was to create the fictional Bank of San Serriffe:

<Blockquote source={{ label: 'Donald Knuth', url: 'https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news08.html' }}>
  After painful deliberation I&apos;ve come up with a new plan, which I hope will be acceptable to all concerned, and perhaps even welcomed as an improvement.
  Instead of rewarding heroic bug-finders with dollars, I shall henceforth award brownie points, otherwise known as hexadecimal dollars (`0x$`).
  From now on it will be kudos, not escudos.
  <br />
  Instead of writing personal checks, I&apos;ll write personal certificates of deposit to each awardee&apos;s account at the Bank of San Serriffe, which is an offshore institution that has branches in Blefuscu and Elbonia on the planet Pincus. 
</Blockquote>

The bank even has a [website](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html) maintaining all account balances.

Now, obviously, reading about the Bank of San Serriffe as "someone in crypto," I found great irony in this: one of the greatest computer scientists ever manually maintains balances on a comically large HTML file with pretend money, when it&apos;s trivially accomplished with blockchains.

Since basically all of my work is public, and I like creating fully on-chain things, I wanted to make my own **5/9 reward checks**: fully on-chain NFTs that I mint to people who submit fixes/suggestions to my work, alongside $5.\bar{5}\cdot10^{-5}$ ETH.
My reward checks obviously don&apos;t require fictional banks or pretend money :).

## 5/9 Reward Checks

I marinated on this idea for 2 years because I didn&apos;t have any good inspiration for the design, and there wasn&apos;t any urgency to do it.
Then, one day, as I finished the 9th interval of a 16√ó400m workout, I visualized the progress in my head:

<div className="w-full flex justify-center">
  <WorkoutVisualizationGraphic />
</div>

The green pixels (labeled 0) are completed intervals, and the blue pixels (labeled 1) are a random selection of 5 out of the 9 completed intervals.
Visualizing the progress and/or time remaining in a run is something I typically do to mentally chunk it up and make it easier for me to finish.
Usually, it&apos;s something simple like reducing 16 to 4 sets of 4: "25%, 50%, 75%, 100%" feels more digestible than "6.25%, 12.5%, 18.75%, ..., 100%".

In this case, I don&apos;t remember what was going through my mind to conjure up a visualization of 5/9; maybe narcissism or love for myself.
Either way, it gave me the idea of generating all 3√ó3 grids, where 5 out of the 9 pixels are highlighted.

This idea reminded me of Knuth&apos;s reward checks because I thought it&apos;d be a fun and representative way to express myself, just like how Knuth is playful with his.
The theme and visualization of 5/9 is an obvious reference to my identity, and it&apos;s also something I&apos;ve [sprinkled](https://github.com/fiveoutofnine/555) [throughout](https://x.com/i/status/1770125990317924673) [my](https://x.com/i/status/1770226545581338921) [previous](https://basescan.org/address/0x555555554F0ef522f41B2C46D941DEB4d731eB65) [work](https://x.com/i/status/1938245036749295757) for fun.
All of this connects nicely to the core idea of this being a [fully on-chain](https://fiveoutofnine.com/blog/on-chain-font) NFT as well.

### Design

I came up with the following as the central element:

I&apos;m pretty happy with this.
There&apos;s ${9\choose5}=126$ ways to fill the 3√ó3 grid, which provides enough visual variety amongst reward checks, and I think it looks pretty nice.
Apart from the highlighted pixels, I fit in a couple other references to 5/9:
- The rotated square is exactly 5/9 of the area of the square containing it.
  You can tell from the grid lines because

<MathDisplay>
  $$\frac{(\text{Side of the rotated square})^{2}}{(\text{Side of the container square})^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{1^{2}+2^{2}}^{2}}{3^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{5}^{2}}{3^{2}}=\frac{5}{9}$$
</MathDisplay>

- The image is 555√ó555 pixels.
- The grid lines are 55px apart.

I was going to just deploy the SVG above as the NFT, but it&apos;s a little too ambiguous.
Since it&apos;s a "check," I wanted something closer to a card with relevant information displayed.
When I created [Curta&apos;s Flag NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/curta), I deliberately designed and [implemented](https://github.com/waterfall-mkt/curta/blob/ae4a9fca354f99e5972b61c3d0b6714339030e78/src/FlagRenderer.sol) them in a generic way to display information related to the NFTs.
I tested it here and liked the look, so I reused the design and code here:

<Callout intent="info">
  I haven&apos;t deployed the NFT yet, but I will link it here when I do.
