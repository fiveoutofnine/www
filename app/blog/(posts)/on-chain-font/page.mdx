I [enjoy](https://gallery.so/fiveoutofnine/galleries/2dXu2CmM2LHQOceZKfh3MYxF36m) fully on-chain projects for many reasons:

* Strongest guarantees of transparency, permanence, and immutability
* Native composition with anything else on-chain and [dynamicism](https://j.mirror.xyz/w8wSN3JLHK1_oNoi2lLF-67w60Wt1WypS_kIbmsYSfE)
* Constraint-driven creativity and innovation

I've deployed a few on-chain projects

and because of the reasons outlined above, nearly every implementation and design choice was made very deliberately.

A commonly required task was to include font files fully on-chain to ensure accurate and consistent rendering of text across all browsers (no fallback fonts or external dependencies to load them in).
However, font files can be quite large (>100 KB), and storing them on-chain can be expensive.

Luckily, you can usually reduce this by >95% to just 2-4 KB with a few optimizations (depending on your usecase)!

## Guide

This post outlines a method to generate optimized font files that can be stored on-chain for a fraction of the cost.
