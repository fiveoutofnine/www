<BlogHeader slug="on-chain-worlds-with-terrain-generation" />

Basic outline of the post:
- Some explanation about Curta, why I wanted to do on-chain worlds (terrain generation, pixel art)
- Figuring out the terrain generation part
  - Implementing the terrain generation part w/ Solidity (+ a bitmap set-up for the desired shape)
- Encoding pixel art super efficiently (compactly)
- Mapping the terrain generation output to the pixel art, pretty trivial

While designing and developing the 2nd competitive programming format to add on [Curta](https://curta.wtf), 

As part of [Curta](https://curta.wtf), a series of fully on-chain EVM competitions,

[Curta](https://curta.wtf) is a fully on-chain competitive programming platform, where some of the best smart contract developers and security researchers compete.
