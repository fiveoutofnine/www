Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through $n$.
There is a house $x$ in between such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right.
If $n$ is between 50 and 500, what are $n$ and $x$?
This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions.
Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist:
He gave a continued fraction.
The unusual part was that it was a solution to the whole class of problems.
Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it.
"It is simple.
The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction.
Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind,"
Ramanujan replied.
