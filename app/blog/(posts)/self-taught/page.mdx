[Leopold Godowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky) was one of the greatest virtuoso pianists and composers of his time, earning the respect of other greats like Rachmaninoff and Arrau, and Hofmann.
He composed [many works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Leopold_Godowsky), but the most famous are his [_54 Studies on Chopin's Études_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_Chopin%27s_%C3%89tudes), where he augments Chopin's already challenging études with impossibly hard techniques like

They're known as some of the most technically difficult piano pieces ever written, and only a few pianists have even tried to perform them.
Classical music typically requires decades of formal training and education, but Godowsky received almost none:

  I would be very glad could I have stated with truth that I was a pupil of [Franz] Liszt or any other great man, but I was not. I have not had three months lessons in my life.

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) was one of the greatest mathematicians, and he made significant contributions to multiple areas of pure math.
Despite growing up in poverty, having almost no education/books, and passing away at just age 32, Ramanujan discovered nearly 3,900 novel, highly unconventional results.
Working as a clerk to support his family, he spent his free time researching in isolation, often having to independently rediscover known results from famous mathematicians like Euler and Jacobi.
There are many stories and [accounts](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2301659) of his
