[Leopold Godowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky) was one of the greatest virtuoso pianists and composers of his time, earning the respect of other greats like Rachmaninoff and Arrau, and Hofmann.
He composed [many works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Leopold_Godowsky), but the most famous are his [_54 Studies on Chopin's Études_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_Chopin%27s_%C3%89tudes), where he augments Chopin's already challenging études with impossibly hard techniques like

They're known as some of the most technically difficult piano pieces ever written, and only a few pianists have even tried to perform them.
Classical music typically requires decades of formal training and education, but Godowsky received almost none:

  I would be very glad could I have stated with truth that I was a pupil of [Franz] Liszt or any other great man, but I was not. I have not had three months lessons in my life.

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) was one of the greatest mathematicians, and he made significant contributions to multiple areas of pure math.
Despite growing up in poverty, having almost no education/books, and passing away at just age 32, Ramanujan discovered nearly 3,900 novel, highly unconventional results.
Working as a clerk to support his family, he spent his free time researching in isolation, often having to independently rediscover known results from famous mathematicians like Euler and Jacobi.
There are many stories and [accounts](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2301659) of his

[The Wright brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers) were aviation pioneers who invented, built, and flew the world's first airplane.
Neither of them had education after high school, and they taught themselves mechanical skills while working their day jobs involving printing presses, bicycles, and motors.
This included learning through relentless experimentation like building their own wind tunnel, collecting aerodynamic data, and conducting many flight experiments.
The first sustained and controlled powered flight took place on December 17, 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

[Dick Fosbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Fosbury) was an Olympic gold medalist high jumper who revolutionized the sport by inventing the

Despite pushback from his coaches and the media, he experimented, refined, and practiced the run-up and jump techniques to minimize the height of athlete's center of gravity throughout the jump and maximize take-off thrust time.
Fosbury went on to win gold at the 1968 Olympics, and no man or woman has won an Olympic medal without using the Fosbury Flop since 1980.

[George Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green) was a mathematical physicist who wrote an [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Application_of_Mathematical_Analysis_to_the_Theories_of_Electricity_and_Magnetism), where he created the first mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and introduced many important concepts like [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem) and [Green's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function).
His theory helped form the foundation for other great scientists like [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) and [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin).
Green was almost entirely self-taught:
he only had 1 year of schooling, and much of his advanced math knowledge came after the age of 30 after he became a member of the [Nottingham Subscription Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromley_House_Library) while working as a miller.
In fact, he even published his essay privately because he didn't think someone with no formal education could should it to a journal.
