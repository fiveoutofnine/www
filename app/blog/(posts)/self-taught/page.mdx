[Leopold Godowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky) was one of the greatest virtuosuo pianists and composers of his time, which earned him the nickname "The Buddha of the Piano."
He composed [many important works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Leopold_Godowsky), but his most famous work is [_54 Studies on Chopin's Études_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_Chopin%27s_%C3%89tudes), where he varies Chopin's already challenging études with impossibly hard techniques like
<AudioSample>countermelodies</AudioSample>,
<AudioSample>transcriptions for left hand solo</AudioSample>,
<AudioSample>interweaving three études together</AudioSample>.
They're known as some of the most technically difficult piano works ever written, and only a few pianists have even tried to perform them. Although classical music typically requires strict formal training and education, Godowsky received almost none:

  I do not remember whether anybody taught me the value and meaning of notes and the use of the fingers of the keyboard, or whether I acquired my knowledge in an autodidactic way, but I do remember that I had no help from my fifth year on.
