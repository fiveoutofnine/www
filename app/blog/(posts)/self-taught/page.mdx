[Leopold Godowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky) was one of the greatest virtuoso pianists and composers of his time, earning the respect of other greats like Rachmaninoff and Arrau, and Hofmann.
He composed [many works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Leopold_Godowsky), but the most famous are his [_54 Studies on Chopin's Études_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_Chopin%27s_%C3%89tudes), where he augments Chopin's already challenging études with impossibly hard techniques like

They're known as some of the most technically difficult piano pieces ever written, and only a few pianists have even tried to perform them.
Classical music typically requires decades of formal training and education, but Godowsky received almost none:

  I would be very glad could I have stated with truth that I was a pupil of [Franz] Liszt or any other great man, but I was not. I have not had three months lessons in my life.

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and he made many groundbreaking, novel contributions to multiple areas of pure math, including problems that were previously considered unsolvable.
Despite having almost no formal training, researching in isolation until age 25 (which he only got out of by mailing British mathematicians), and passing away at just age 32, he produced nearly 3,900 results.
Many of these were completely novel, highly unconventional, and amazed his contemporaries. Most have been since proven correct (some decades later).
