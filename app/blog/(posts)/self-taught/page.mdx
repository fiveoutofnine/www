[Leopold Godowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky) was one of the greatest virtuoso pianists and composers of his time, which earned him the nickname "The Buddha of the Piano."
He composed [many important works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Leopold_Godowsky), but his most famous work is [_54 Studies on Chopin's Études_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_Chopin%27s_%C3%89tudes), where he varies Chopin's already challenging études with impossibly hard techniques like

They're known as some of the most technically difficult piano pieces ever written, and only a few pianists have even tried to perform them. Although classical music typically requires strict formal training and education, Godowsky received almost none:

  I do not remember whether anybody taught me the value and meaning of notes and the use of the fingers of the keyboard, or whether I acquired my knowledge in an autodidactic way, but I do remember that I had no help from my fifth year on.

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and he made many groundbreaking, novel contributions to multiple areas of pure math, including problems that were previously considered unsolvable.
Despite having almost no formal training, researching in isolation until age 25 (which he only got out of by mailing British mathematicians), and passing away at just age 32, he produced nearly 3,900 results.
Many of these were completely novel, highly unconventional, and amazed his contemporaries. Most have been since proven correct (some decades later).
